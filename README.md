## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Tried to apply very basics concepts to achieve this without thinking much through it at first, just what was my first thought about how to solve this problem.
Had some issues with <img> element overflowing its parent container after applying some padding but sorted using Flexbox.


### Continued development

Still crawling the first moves on coding HTML + CSS after getting into some studying. Good I knew I knew something could do the change I needed and was easy to find out how.

### Useful resources

- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer] - This helped me all the way down and is still my primary resource.
